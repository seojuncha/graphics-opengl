# graphics-opengl
I found that a lot of C/C++ works are related with a graphic system. 


## Why OpenGL?
Simple thing, by now. Moreover, I don't like a os-specific, closed platform.

## Environment Setup

### Getting Started with VS2022

### GLFW and GLAD
OpenGL is not a library itself but a specification like an API.

### Create a window
object, context, 

### Graphics Pipeline
3D(OpenGl) -> 2D(screen)

3D coordinate(x, y, z), primitives, vertex(collection of vecticies), shader

range (-1.0<=x<=1.0), vertex buffer object(vbo), graphic memory, 

vertex buffer object, vertex array object

#### Why traiangle?

## TODO
- [] Make it run on macOS and Linux by using CMake
